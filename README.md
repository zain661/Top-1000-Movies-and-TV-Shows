# Top-1000-Movies-and-TV-Shows

Introduction: In order to identify the most popular genre and the director of the most highly rated films and television programs, this research 
will examine the IMDB dataset of the top 1000 films and shows. For additional investigation, the dataset was obtained from Kaggle 
and imported into a pandas dataframe.

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: The dataframe's 'Genre' column contained details about the genre of each film or television program.
This column's analysis allowed us to identify the genre that appears in the dataset the most frequently, a sign of the genre's popularity.

Genre Distribution:A new dataframe was built that contained the number of films and television programs in each genre in order to visualize the distribution
of genres in the dataset. The data were grouped by genre, and the frequency of each genre was counted. 
The generated dataframe contained the information required to produce a bar chart using the matplotlib library that displayed the most
common movie and television show genres.

Director with the Most Top-Rated Movies/TV Shows:Finding the director of the most well regarded films and television programs was another component of the analysis.
In order to do this, a new dataframe was developed that comprised the number of films and television series that each filmmaker has directed. 
We might identify which director has the most highly rated productions by categorizing the data by director and counting the occurrences.

In conclusion, the pandas analysis of the IMDB dataset of the top 1000 films and TV episodes revealed the most popular genre and the director with the most highly regarded works. We can discover useful data that can inform decision-making in the entertainment sector by utilizing the power of data analysis. 
Additional insights and chances for advancement in the film and television industries may emerge from further analysis and examination of the dataset.
